            <div class="content">

                <p>I aim to provide a very transparent service and have tried to answer any questions you may have below. It
                    is always best to discuss your individual child&#8217;s needs with me at our initial meeting, but I hope
                    the below gives you a general outline of what to expect.</p>
                <p>If you feel that something is missing or you have a specific question regarding your child, please <a href="./contact/">don&#8217;t hesitate to ask</a>.</p>
                <h2><strong>Initial visit and settling in</strong></h2>
                <p>The most important thing to me is making sure that your child will flourish in my setting.</p>
                <p>In order to do this, I will invite both you and your child to an initial face-to-face meeting where we can
                    discuss your child&#8217;s needs, have a tour of the setting and your child can explore and play.</p>
                <p>If you would like to continue the process after this, we can draw up an individual settling in plan together.
                    This will include settling in sessions (chargeable at hourly rate) that increase in length leading up
                    to your child&#8217;s start date and will be largely guided by your child&#8217;s needs.</p>
                <h2><b>Fees and charges</b></h2>
                <p>As of August 2017, my hourly rate per child is £4.25. I am currently applying to accept childcare vouchers.</p>
                <p>I can, within reason, offer some evening care (7pm onwards) at either my setting or your own home. This would
                    be charged at a flat rate of £9.00/hour.</p>
                <p>To secure a place, I ask for half a typical month&#8217;s payment upfront as a retainer. The other half will
                    be due on your child&#8217;s start date. After this, each month will be paid in advance and payment will
                    be due by the first of the month. Any variation will be added to or subtracted from the following invoice.</p>
                <p>Please let me know as soon as possible if you think you may be late with a payment. A fee of £3.00/day may
                    be applied for late payments.</p>
                <h2><b>Food and drink</b></h2>
                <p>You are more than welcome to provide your own food, drinks and snacks for your child or I can provide home-made,
                    healthy meals and snacks for your child at an extra cost.</p>
                <p>As of August 2017, this is £1.25 per meal, with each meal including a snack afterwards.</p>
                <p>Water is always available for every child at no charge.</p>
                <p>Please bring any breast milk, formula milk or special dietary milk that your child requires with you at drop
                    off.
                </p>
                <p>I am able to adjust menus for special diets, baby-led weaning, traditional weaning.</p>
                <p>I use the <a href="http://www.childrensfoodtrust.org.uk/">Children’s Food Trust</a> menus as inspiration for my menus and their menu planning checklist to ensure I am providing a balanced plate and correct portion sizes.</p>

                <h2><strong>Medication and first aid</strong></h2>
                <p>If your child requires prescription or non-prescription medication to be given while in my care, you will
                    be expected to provide this medicine and sign a permission form. A permission form is required for each
                    medicine and must be updated with any change of dosage.</p>
                <p>I have undertaken Paediatric First Aid training and Paediatric Anaphylaxis training which includes administration
                    of Adrenaline Auto-Injector Pens.</p>
                <h2><strong>Clothes, nappies and other sundries</strong></h2>
                <p>Please dress your child in clothing appropriate for messy play and ensure that you bring weather appropriate
                    outerwear (including sun creams). I also ask that you bring along an additional change of clothes for
                    your child. I am happy to store a few extra clothes and outerwear for you.</p>
                <p>You will be required to provide nappies (cloth or disposable) and other small nappy care items (cloth or
                    disposable wipes, creams, nappy bags etc). If you prefer, you can bring enough for the week ahead in
                    and I can store it for you. I am happy to use wet bags for cloth nappies, provided you are able to take
                    them home at the end of each session.</p>
                <p>I ask that you label clothing and bags with your child&#8217;s name to avoid any confusion.</p>
                <h2><strong>Holidays and illness</strong></h2>
                <p>I take four weeks of holiday per year and will give you at least three months written notice of these. You
                    do not have to pay for my services on these dates or any days that I am unavailable to care for your
                    child (ie. due to my own illness).</p>
                <p>Unless I have specified them as holiday, I am open as usual on bank holidays and throughout school holidays.</p>
                <p>You will be charged my standard rate for any absence due to your child&#8217;s illness or holidays that fall
                    outside of my own.</p>
                <p>In order to maintain my availability for your child and other children and to avoid spreading unnecessary
                    illness, I ask that you contact me prior to drop off if your child is unwell to discuss whether your
                    child should attend the session or not.</p>
                <h2><strong>Safeguarding, protection and welfare</strong></h2>
                <p>Both myself and my partner hold valid DBS certificates and are signed up to the DBS update service.</p>
                <p><a href="./pdf/SCowperthwaite_Policy_safeguarding_protection_welfare.pdf"> My safeguarding, protection and welfare policy</a> is available to read and covers:</p>

                <h2>Equal Opportunities</h2>
                <p>In line with the <a href="https://www.foundationyears.org.uk/files/2017/03/EYFS_STATUTORY_FRAMEWORK_2017.pdf">Early Years Foundation Stage</a>                    2017, I agree that each child is a unique child and I provide an enabling environment in which their
                    experiences respond to their individual needs.</p>
                <p>I have read, understand and will put into practice requirements and guidance contained in the Equality Act
                    (2010), the Children and Families Act (2014), Early Years Foundation Stage 2017 and SEND code of practice:

                <h2>Complaints</h2>
                <p>I aim to work in close partnership with you to meet the needs of your child. Maintaining good communication
                    between us will aid this. I expect and encourage you to immediately bring to my attention any aspect
                    of my service you are not happy with so that every effort can be made to resolve the issue. You can make
                    a complaint to me verbally, or in writing.</p>

                    welfare requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage and/or the Childcare Register. I will notify
